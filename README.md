# Movie title translator

While I was traveling around South America, I would sometimes talk about a movie or a series with other foreign travelers but I or they wouldn't know the original title in English, the language we used to communicate.

In France, it is quite common to have American movies whose original English title was translated to... another title in English. Yup.

For instance, <i>The Hangover</i> (2009)'s title in France is <i>Very Bad Trip</i> (which is a pun, a "bad trip" meaning also a bad experience when being high). Still, the French Canadians are more chauvinistic than the French themselves (the government of Québec adopted a law for making French translations mandatory), so they called it <i>Lendemain de veille</i> (literally <i>Next day after the day before</i>  ¯\ _(ツ)_ /¯ ) 

I had the idea of making this little app that could translate me a movie title from a language to another. Check it for yourself soon!
